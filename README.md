# StuBank Project

To Run the project, it can be built and ran using docker using the instructions below and the dockerfile. Alternatively, it can also be open in PyCharm or another python IDE, and built and ran, using the pipfile to set up the working environment.

Depending on the connection speed and system performance, this may take time in both docker, and loading the project 


## Docker Support
